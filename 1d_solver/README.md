## Instructions to run:

- From within MATLAB, navigate to the folder containing this README document;

- Type 'solver1d' in the command window to start the applet


## Learning questions

Run the solver with the 'Backward', 'Forward' and 'Central' schemes; for each scheme try both positive and negative wavespeeds.

- Which combinations of scheme and wavespeed sign produce a converged solution and which do not converge?

- What is additionally required to converge the central scheme?

- What is the maximum CFL number for which the schemes will converge?

### Optional extra (after Lectures 5 & 6):
Implement the upwind method for the linear and non-linear equations.
