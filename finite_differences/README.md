## Instructions to run:

- From within MATLAB, navigate to the folder containing this README document;

- type 'taylor_demo' in the command window to start the Taylor series applet;

- Type 'fd_demo' in the command window to start the finite differences applet.

## Learning questions

- What two approaches can be used to decrease the error in the gradient approximation?

- What is the minimum number of finite difference points required to estimate the Nth derivative using
  a) central differences
  b) forward/backward differences

- For a fixed derivative level, how does the minimum error vary with the number of stencil points

- How does the minimum error vary with derivative level assuming you use the least number of stencil points in each case

Optional extra:
The minimum error does not always occur at the smallest step size (delta x) - research online to find out why.
